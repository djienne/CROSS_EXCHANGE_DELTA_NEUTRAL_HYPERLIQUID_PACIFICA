# ü§ñ Hyperliquid-Pacifica Cross-Exchange Funding Rate Delta Neutral Bot

Automated delta-neutral bot that captures funding rate spreads between Hyperliquid and Pacifica perpetual futures exchanges.
Can be also used to farm trading volume while limit risk (refreshes positions every `hold_duration_hours=12` hours by default, but can be changed).

## üìä Strategy

The bot maintains market-neutral positions by going **long on the exchange with lower funding rate** and **short on the exchange with higher funding rate**, collecting the funding rate differential while minimizing directional price risk.
Can be also used to farm trading volime while limit risk (refreshes positions every `hold_duration_hours=12` hours by default, but can be changed).

**üí° Example**: If Hyperliquid funding is +10% APR and Pacifica is +50% APR:
- Long position on Hyperliquid (pay 10%)
- Short position on Pacifica (receive 50%)
- Net profit: ~40% APR

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. üì¶ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. üîê Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys:
- **Hyperliquid**: Wallet address and private key
- **Pacifica**: Solana wallet, API public/private keys

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Bot

Edit `bot_config.json`:

```json
{
  "symbols_to_monitor": ["BTC", "ETH", "SOL", "ASTER", ...],
  "leverage": 3,
  "base_capital_allocation": 100.0,
  "hold_duration_hours": 12.0,
  "min_net_apr_threshold": 5.0
}
```

**Key Parameters**:
- `base_capital_allocation`: Base capital in USD (actual position = base √ó leverage √ó 0.98 buffer)
- `leverage`: Target leverage (auto-capped at 20x, reduced if exchange limits are lower)
- `hold_duration_hours`: How long to hold each position
- `min_net_apr_threshold`: Minimum funding spread to open position

### 4. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

```bash
python hyperliquid_pacifica_hedge.py
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Build and start
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f hedge-bot

# Stop
docker-compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

See `DOCKER.md` for detailed deployment guide.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **üîç Analyze**: Fetches funding rates from both exchanges every cycle
2. **üéØ Select**: Chooses symbol with highest net APR above threshold
3. **üìà Open**: Opens delta-neutral position (long/short) with synchronized leverage
4. **‚è±Ô∏è Hold**: Monitors position health, PnL, and stop-loss for configured duration
5. **üìâ Close**: Closes both positions simultaneously
6. **‚è∏Ô∏è Wait**: Brief cooldown before next cycle

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- ‚úÖ **20x Leverage Hard Cap**: Never exceeds 20x regardless of config
- ‚úÖ **Leverage Synchronization**: Both exchanges use identical leverage
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Stop-Loss**: Tighter stops at higher leverage (~60% capital loss trigger), **triggered by worst leg PnL** to protect against one-sided losses
- ‚úÖ **2% Safety Buffer**: Automatic reduction of base capital allocation
- ‚úÖ **Symbol Filtering**: Only trades symbols available on both exchanges
- ‚úÖ **State Recovery**: Automatically recovers position state after restart
- ‚úÖ **Quantity Precision**: Uses coarser step size to ensure identical quantities
- ‚úÖ **Long-term PnL Tracking**: Tracks initial capital and displays cumulative performance across all cycles

## üíµ Position Sizing Examples

With `base_capital_allocation: 100`:

| Leverage | Safety Buffer | Position Size per Exchange |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| 1x       | $98           | $98                        |
| 3x       | $98           | $294                       |
| 5x       | $98           | $490                       |
| 10x      | $98           | $980                       |

Position size is further reduced if insufficient margin available (uses 95% of max available).

## ‚õî Stop-Loss Levels

Stop-loss is **triggered by the worst leg PnL** (not total PnL) to protect against one-sided losses that could lead to liquidation.

| Leverage | Stop-Loss % | Capital Loss at Trigger | Buffer Before Liquidation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1x       | -50%        | 50%                     | ~50%                      |
| 3x       | -20%        | 60%                     | ~40%                      |
| 5x       | -12%        | 60%                     | ~40%                      |
| 10x      | -6%         | 60%                     | ~40%                      |
| 20x      | -3%         | 60%                     | ~40%                      |

**When triggered**: Both positions are immediately closed via market orders, PnL is calculated, and the bot enters a waiting period before starting a new cycle.

## üìä Monitoring

The bot displays comprehensive color-coded status during position holding (every 60 seconds by default):

<img src="screen.png" alt="Bot Status Display" width="800">

**Status includes:**
- Position timing and time remaining
- Position sizes and notional value
- Account balances and total equity
- **Long-term PnL** since bot start (tracked via initial capital)
- Current leverage on both exchanges
- Real-time funding rates and spread
- Individual leg PnL (Hyperliquid and Pacifica)
- Total unrealized PnL
- **Risk metrics**: Stop-loss level, current PnL %, worst leg performance, distance to stop-loss

## üö® Emergency Position Closer

Close all open positions on both exchanges:

```bash
# Interactive mode - shows positions and asks confirmation
python emergency_close.py

# Close specific symbol only
python emergency_close.py --symbol BTC

# Close all without confirmation
python emergency_close.py --force

# Preview without executing
python emergency_close.py --dry-run
```

The script scans symbols from `bot_config.json` and displays all open positions with PnL before closing.
